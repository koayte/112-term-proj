# About the Game #

Brawl Bars is an online battle arena and third-person shooter game. In a 2D map, the player competes in a 1v1 knockout battle (the enemy is a bot) with the following rules and mechanics.

## Rules ##
* Each player has two shooting modes: “normal” and “super”. 
    * Normal mode: full ammunition consists of 3 shots, which take time to recharge 
    * Super mode: a more powerful shot, which is activated when the damage wheel is full. The higher the player’s damage dealt to the enemy, the more the damage wheel recharges.
* Each player has a health bar that decreases as they are dealt damage. When it hits zero, the player is killed. 
* The player can hide in bushes, where they are not visible to the enemy.
* A match consists of 3 rounds, and whoever wins at least 2 rounds wins the match.

## Mechanics ##
* WASD / Arrow buttons for navigating 
* Mouse to aim 
* F key to toggle between shooting modes once Super mode is activated
* Spacebar / Mouse press to shoot
